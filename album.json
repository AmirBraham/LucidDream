Wonder what it's like when you pray\nIs He standing in front of you so you could look at His face?\nWhen you talk to Him, does He talk back?\nYou ever have conversations about what you regr\u0435t?\nOr did it all go away once you got there? Do\u0435s each breath\nTake you closer to God? Would you say that you cry less?\nDo you feel at peace yet?\nDo you laugh more?\nDo you feel like heaven is everything you could ask for?\nI ever make it up there, when I see you, I hope you're smiling\n'Cause you deserve it, pray to God that you found joy\nAnd always know that\u2014\n[Chorus]\nYou don't gotta cry, you don't gotta cry no more\nI hope you're up there lookin' down on us with a smile on your face\nYou don't gotta cry, you don't gotta cry no more\nI hope you're up there with God feeling loved and set free from your pain\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, I look at the situation you had\nMighta made a mistake of leaving, but it's makin' me sad\nThinkin' of you, how you grew up tryna cope with your past\nWere you like me in your relationships and pushed away Dad?\nI gotta know, Mama, did you think you were trash?\nSomething disposable, that nobody could love or be glad\nTo say they was with you, that issue is a issue I have\nThat's why it hurt me when Britney gave me those letters you sent\nI barely read any of 'em knowin' I'd let them go to my head\nAnd get to me, especially when I feel I related\nMight not be around for my babies, but know when I say that I love you, that I mean it okay?\n'Cause nobody's perfect\nYeah, I guess we all fall short\nAnd I can't hold this unforgiveness in my heart no more\nSo just know you're\nLoveable to me, and of course\nYou'll always be Mama to us, we'll save a table for four\nAnd know that\u2014\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYou don't gotta cry, you don't gotta cry no more\nI hope you're up there lookin' down on us with a smile on your face (On your face)\nYou don't gotta cry, You don't gotta cry no more (No more)\nI hope you're up there with God feeling loved and set free from your pain (Mama)\nYou don't gotta cry, no\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, I'm grown now\nTook me a while to see the bigger picture\n'Cause if you were here today and I was talking with ya\nIt'd be a lot of tears of joy falling on my sweatshirt\nProlly followed by some apologies and \"Mom, I missed ya\"\nYeah, I pray you see me down here lookin' up\nStill got a lot of things that I need healin' from\nBut I'll get there eventually, so don't you worry none\nI just hope you finally got some peace and you feel happy\nMom, I love youEmbed"
